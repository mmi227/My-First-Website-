# My-First-Website-

# What to know
Hi All, I recently learned HTML, CSS, and JAVA for basic front-end web development.
My aspiration is to be hired as a Brand Marketer focusing in SEO, PPC, and email marketing.
This is a career transition so im hoping my self learned coding skills will give my resume a bump.

# How you can help
I will not make the rookie move of flat out asking "why wont this work", but rather constructive feedback.
Thanks in advance and code on!
